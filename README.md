# In-season-forecasting-using-ARIMA
we have used different variants of ARIMA models to predict the canopy features like Canopy Cover, Canopy Height and Excessive Green Index from 28 days of cultivation period to the end of the cultivation cycle for cotton crops (116 days). The predicted values were compared against the actual values and the resulting Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was used as the measure of efficiency of the model. As the resulting yield of the cotton crop is a function of the canopy features, accurate early in-season prediction of canopy features is important as it provides the grower with a very essential tool to take early management decisions to maximize yield at the end of the harvesting period.
